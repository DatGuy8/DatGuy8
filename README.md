I'm John Tran, a talented Software Developer/Engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. Currently based in the sunny city of Sunnyvale, California, I enjoy being part of the vibrant tech scene here. However, my journey began in the picturesque paradise of Honolulu, Hawaii, where I first discovered my love for technology.

With a strong foundation in software development, I constantly strive to push the boundaries of what's possible. My expertise lies in designing and implementing robust applications that solve real-world problems. I thrive in collaborative environments and love working on projects that make a positive impact.

Feel free to explore my repositories and discover the exciting projects I've worked on. If you have any questions or just want to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's create something awesome together!

Happy coding! 😄🚀</p>
